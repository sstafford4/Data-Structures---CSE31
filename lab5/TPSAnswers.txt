Activity 1:
	1. MARS stands for MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator. 
 
	5a. I loaded the assembly file by clicking on the little folder icon and choosing the desired file
	5b. In the top corner, under the Run section, there is an option to assemble the code. Then, if you go back to the same section
	, you can run the assembled code. 
	5d. You cannot run the code before assembling it. 
	5e. You can select the step option to run the code line by line.
	5f.You can reassemble the program or click reset. 

Activity 2:
	1. .data and .text are used to seperate variable declarations and assembly instructions, while .word allocates and initializes space for the variables. 
	2. Line 10 establishes a branch on equal to the finish branch if $t3 and $t0 are equal. 
	3. Line 15 jumps back to the top of the fib branch. 
	4. To set a breakpoint in MARS, assemble the code, go to the execute tab, and click the BKPT box at the desired line. 
	5. You can just keep clicking the step option from the Run section. 
	6. On the right side of the screen, there is a box to view all of the registers. You can manually change the values of each register from there. 
	7. Syscall causes a system exception that transfers control from the user space to the kernel space.
