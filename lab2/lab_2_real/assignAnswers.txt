Individual Assignment 1;
    1) The error is at line 22. 
    2) You make sure that every instance of scanf is using &input instead of just input. 

    3) The code isnt working because sum is set to equal 0 in the main() function. 
    4) You can probably fix it by getting rid of the double sum parameter in the read_values function and
        doing all of the calculations and variable inputs in there. 

Individual Assignment 2:
    1) The result is HELLOhellohello, it prints the second string twice. This is not the expected output.
        It also doesnt stop running. 
    2) When inputting HI and hi, it is all sorts of messed up. it prints HIhiOhellohi. 
    3) It looks the strings were stuck together wrong. They clip through eachother. It probably happens because the function
        tells it to place the strings in between eachother in a weird way.
