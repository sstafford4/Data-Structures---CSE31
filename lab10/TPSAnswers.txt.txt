Activity 1: 
	
	1. A cache is used to reduce the average cost to access data from the main memory. It's smaller, faster, and located closer to a processor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations.
	We need the cache to make accessing data from memory a lot faster. 
	4. 4 bits for 16B. log_2(blockSize) is the function for number of bits in offset given blocksize. No it is not practical because it would store 4 bytes of data for only 1 byte.
	6. Yes, cache_size = amountofblocks * block_size
	7. Use them as a tag to figure out which data is in the cache.
	8. a) 2^20 = 1048575
	b) 3
	c) 16
	d) 4
	e) 13 bits == 20-3-4
	g) 13tag+ 1v+ 1d+8*8=79

Activity 2: 
	1.Each block of main memory maps to a fixed location in the cache, therefore, if 2 different blocks map to the same location and are continually referenced, the 2 blocks will continually swap in and out (thrashing).
 	3. 2^10/2^2 log_2(2^10/2^2) = 8 bits; sets = numberofblocks/blocksize log_2(sets) = indexbits
	4. a) 2^20 = 1048576
	b) 3
	c) 16
	d) 8
	e) 3
	f) 14
	h) 14 + 1 + 1  +8 * 8 = 80
