Activity 1:
	1. The starting address for the text segment is 0x00400000 and the starting address for the data segment is 0x10010000
	2. The difference between the True Assembly code (basic area) and the MIPS assembly code (Source area) seems to be that the Basic area is more the way 
the machine reads it, showing addi as addiu (addi unsigned), the registers as numbers instead of $t_, and showing certain addresses. I think the source area is the code
but more readable/understandable for humans. 
	3. In the data segment, there is a 32 bit difference between data addresses. 
	4. For each address, there are 8 columns. 
	5. I dont really know what the relationship is between the 8 columns for each data address. 
	6. In the .text section, set the variable like variable:, then allocate space for it using .word [value]. 
	7. It looks like the variable m is saved to the second column of the first address of the Data segment, which is 0x10010000. 
	9. str1 is stored in 3 addresses in the first address of the Data segment. It uses the Value(+8), Value(+c), and Value(+10) columns of the 0x10010000 address. 
	10. Upon clicking the ASCII box, I honestly do not understand how to interpret this. I think it lines up with what was discussed in Lab4. 
	12. la $t3, n loads the address of the label or variable into the desired register.
