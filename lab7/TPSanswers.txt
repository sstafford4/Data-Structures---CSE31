TPS Activity 1:
	1. Functions have a return value for whatever code called it. Procedures are very similar to functions, but they do not
	return anything. Functions determine HOW something is done, while procedures determine WHEN something is done. Methods are 
	all of the functions or procedures that are created or called within a class. Methods are only seen in object-oriented programming. 
	2. The SUM label is on line 20. It adds that values of n and m, then jumps registers to the contents of $ra. 
	3. I dont think that j can be used in place of jr in this context. If we jumped back to the base code, it would just loop instead of starting off
	where it left off. 
	4. The return address is saved on line 11, right before the program jumps to SUM. The return address is set to 0 by this line. 
	5. The address that the program should return to from SUM is 0x00400020, which is the address of addi $a0, $v0, 0. This sets m to equal the value of $v0 i think.
	6. 

Activity 2:
	1. I think that proc2 is going to return 38. This answer has been  verified. 
	2. SUM knows where to return because of the jal instruction instead of j. After SUM jumps to SUB, the return address is linked to that of SUB? 
	You might want to change that for jal to j just so that the $ra registr isnt linked to SUB. 
	3.The values are actually overwritten, which i think could be fixed by storing the values on the stack. 
`	4. The value on line 25 is overwritten.
